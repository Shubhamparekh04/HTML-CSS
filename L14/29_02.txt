object-fit: cover/contain/ fill, scale-down and none.;

object-fit is a CSS property that controls how images or videos fit inside their containers.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


It has different options:

fill: The image stretches to completely fill the container, which might distort its shape.
contain: The image fits inside the container while keeping its original proportions.
cover: The image covers the container completely, possibly cutting off some parts.
none or scale-down: The image keeps its original size unless it's too large, in which case it's scaled down.



img {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;
}
