Wire frame:
- A wireframe in HTML is a skeletal framework or blueprint of a webpage's structure.
- It consists of basic HTML elements like divs, headers, sections, and others.
- Wireframes lack visual design elements such as colors, images, or detailed styling.
- They are used early in the design process to plan layout and content organization.
- Wireframes help designers and developers visualize the functionality and flow of a website or application.
- Placeholder text, like "Lorem Ipsum," is often used to represent content.
- Wireframes facilitate effective communication and collaboration among project stakeholders.
